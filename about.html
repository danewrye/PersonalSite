            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p class="general">Hello again! My name is Dane Wrye. I'm a computer science major at the Georgia Institute of technology, where I will be heading into my junior year! I'm from Reno, Nevada, and I like to think the vastness of the desert has instilled a . That it was a part of what drove me to computer science. </p>
            <p class="cs">Because computer science because it puts the raw ability to create in your hands. And the combination of ability and imagination is a deadly one.</p>
            <p class="self">While I love computer science (i did major in it, after all!) there's plenty more to me beyond the screens and whiteboards. And they don't have to be mutually exculusive: working at the intersection of my academic and perosnal interests always gives me a great deal of pleasure.</p>
